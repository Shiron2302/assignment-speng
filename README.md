# Support Engineer Test

### How to run and dependencies

You will need a webserver to run the test page. You can obviously use any web server you like or the project comes with a prepackaged http server.

To run the project's webserver you will need to install npm and node.js. You can download package for system here: https://nodejs.org/en/

To serve the project run 

`npm run server`

This will launch a webserver on default port 80.
